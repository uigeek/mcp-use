5. Open a Pull Request

## Release Process

### Automated Release Workflow

We use GitHub Actions to automate our release process, connecting GitHub Releases with npm publishing.

#### For Maintainers

1. **Prepare for Release**:

   Update the version in `package.json` using one of these commands:

   ```bash
   # For patch releases (0.0.x) - Bug fixes
   pnpm run release

   # For minor releases (0.x.0) - New features
   pnpm run release:minor

   # For major releases (x.0.0) - Breaking changes
   pnpm run release:major
   ```

   This will:

   - Update the version in package.json
   - Create a git tag
   - Push the changes and tag to GitHub

2. **Create GitHub Release**:

   - Go to GitHub repository → "Releases" → "Draft a new release"
   - Choose the tag that was just created
   - Fill in release notes detailing what's new, fixes, and any breaking changes
   - Click "Publish release"

3. **Automated Publishing**:

   The GitHub Action will automatically:

   - Verify the package version matches the GitHub tag
   - Run linting and build checks
   - Generate a changelog from commits since the last release
   - Update the GitHub release with the changelog
   - Publish to npm with the version from package.json
   - Update the Contributors list in the README
   - Send a notification upon successful publish (if configured)

### Setting Up Automation (For Repository Owners)

To set up automated publishing:

1. Generate an NPM access token:

   - Go to npmjs.com → User Settings → Access Tokens
   - Create a new token with "Automation" type and publish permissions

2. Add the token to GitHub repository secrets:

   - Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets → Actions
   - Add a new secret named `NPM_TOKEN` with the value of your NPM token

3. (Optional) Discord notifications:
   - Create a Discord webhook in your server
   - Add the webhook URL as a GitHub repository secret named `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`

## Updating Contributors

Contributors are automatically updated in the README.md file whenever a push is made to the main branch, using the [BobAnkh/add-contributors](https://github.com/BobAnkh/add-contributors) GitHub Action.
